# Ingame Proof

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg-Q41yez8&feature=youtu.be) also contains 4x base drone attack speed and this was the outcome when it also inherited 20 Soldier Syringes.

# FAQ

Does this work with the Back-up drones?

Currently no, but I'll try implementing that soon!
