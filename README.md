# Basil's Drones Inherit Items
A mod that allows **all** drones and turrets (and then some) to inherit items from the player when purchased.

**Now configurable!** 

All drones and turrets are affected by this mod. It will only inherit the items from a player's inventory at the time of purchase or activation.

## Installation
1. Install [BepInEx Mod Pack](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/)
2. Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/BasilPanda/RoR2DronesInheritItems/releases/) or get it [here](https://thunderstore.io/package/BasilPanda/DronesInheritItems/).
3. Download the latest DronesInheritItems.dll
4. Move DronesInheritItems.dll to your \BepInEx\plugins folder

## Configuration

1. To find the config file, first start up the game with DronesInheritItems.dll in your \BepInEx\plugins folder already!
2. Then go to \BepInEx\config and open com.Basil.DronesInheritItems.cfg

Please check the config and assign values properly! *I didn't handle bad values.*
